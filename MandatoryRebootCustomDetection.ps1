	.SYNOPSIS
		Mandatory Reboot Custom Detection Method
	
	.DESCRIPTION
		This script will read the last time a system rebooted from the event viewer logs. It then calculates the number of days since that time. If the number of days equals or exceeds the RebootThreshold variable, the script will exit with a return code 0 and no data output. No data output is read by SCCM as a failure. If the number of days is less than the RebootThreshold, then a message is written saying the system is within the threshold and the script exits with a return code of 0. SCCM reads an error code 0 with data output as a success.
